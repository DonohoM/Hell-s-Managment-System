# 📘 **Hell’s Management System**

Hell’s Management System is a console-based simulation where the **Grim Reaper** manages souls across different afterlife locations. The program allows users to add new souls, resurrect or reap souls, search for specific souls, and manage multiple afterlife realms dynamically.

This project demonstrates fundamental and intermediate OOP concepts including classes, dynamic memory management, vectors, searching, and modular program structure.

# 🧱 **Project Overview**

The system consists of three main components:

### **🕊️ Soul Class**

Represents an individual soul with attributes such as:

* Name
* Death date
* Soul ID
* Age
* Location
* Availability (living vs. deceased)


Souls can:

* Be displayed
* Be "reaped" (made available in the afterlife)
* Be "resurrected" (returned to the living world)


---

### **🌌 Afterlife Class**

Each afterlife location stores a collection of souls using a dynamic `std::vector<Soul*>`.

It supports:

* Adding souls
* Removing souls
* Displaying souls
* Searching for a specific soul


---

### **🌍 AfterlifeList Class**

A manager that tracks **multiple afterlife realms**.
It allows:

* Creating new locations
* Destroying locations
* Searching across all realms
* Displaying inventories for all locations


---

### **🖥️ Main UI Loop**

An interactive terminal menu lets the user:

1. Add a new soul
2. Find a soul
3. Return a soul to/from the living
4. View or edit afterlife inventories

# 🛠️ **How to Build & Run**

This project includes a **Makefile**, allowing users to build and run with just a few commands.

## ✅ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DonohoM/Hell-s-Managment-System.git
```

## ✅ 2. Navigate Into the Source Directory

```bash
cd Hell-s-Managment-System/CS\(221\)Project_1
```

## ✅ 3. Build the Program

```bash
make
```

This produces an executable called:

```
hell_management
```

## ▶️ 4. Run the Program

```bash
./hell_management
```

## 🧹 5. Clean Build Files

```bash
make clean
```
